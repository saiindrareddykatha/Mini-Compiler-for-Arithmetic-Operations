# Mini-Compiler-for-Arithmetic-Operations
The "Mini Compiler for Arithmetic Operations" is a software project designed to parse, 
analyze, and execute arithmetic expressions written in a simple programming language. The 
primary goal of this project is to create a compact and efficient compiler that can handle basic 
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The compiler follows a multi-stage process, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, 
semantic analysis, code generation, and code optimization. 
This mini compiler is not intended for extensive language support but rather focuses on the 
core principles of compiler design. It provides a hands-on experience for students and 
developers interested in learning about compilers and programming language implementation 
while offering a functional tool for basic arithmetic expression evaluation.
